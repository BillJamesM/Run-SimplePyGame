# Run-SimplePyGame

Welcome to my first game project! I want to give credit to the original creators of the assets used in this project, as none of the assets you see here are mine.

## About the Project

I'm learning how to use Python and to really apply myself I wanted to make a game.

## Credits

All assets used in this project were obtained from [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode). 
Please check out the original creators' work and give them credit for their contributions.
